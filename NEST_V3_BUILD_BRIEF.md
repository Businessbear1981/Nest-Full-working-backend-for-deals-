# NEST V3 — Complete Build Brief

**Date:** 2026-05-23
**From:** Sean Gilmore
**For:** Next Claude Code session / Kevin
**Repo:** github.com/Businessbear1981/NEST-ADVISORS-V3
**Local:** C:/Users/sgill/nest
**Backend:** Flask, port 8000 (271 routes)
**Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript, port 8100
**Priority:** CRITICAL — the platform looks like an investment bank but doesn't work like one yet. Numbers must flow through a real workflow. No placeholders. No fake generated deals.

---

## WHERE WE ARE (Honest State)

### What EXISTS and RUNS:
- Home page with bottom masthead
- Sidebar with full org chart (all sections, all links)
- 39 module pages (most are populated templates, not functional workflows)
- Backend: 271 Flask routes across treasury, phoenix, napkin, bond structuring, hawkeye, eagleeye, etc.
- TreasuryDesk (4 tabs, mock Ramp data)
- PhoenixDesk (3 tabs, 5 demo deals)
- Back of the Napkin calculator (backend working, frontend form needed)
- Bernard concierge (professional tone, routes to Claude API)
- Demo data seeded for covenants (6), draws (5), tenants (5)

### What DOES NOT WORK:
- **Operations Workbench is not built** — the deal detail page requires auth + a created deal, and the workflow between modules doesn't function
- **Command Center is static** — shows a bond command component, not a real pipeline view
- **No data flows between modules** — each module generates its own fake numbers independently
- **EagleEye is full of fabricated deals** — 1,103 lines of fake signals that don't match reality
- **Deal Intake doesn't feed downstream** — you can create a deal record but nothing computes from it
- **Dashboards show static numbers** — not computed from any real data
- **No real data connectors** — FRED, EMMA, EDGAR are specced but not built

---

## THE PRODUCT (What It Should Do)

NEST is a digital investment bank. The workflow is:

```
CLIENT/CREDIT OFFICER SUBMITS DEAL
  ↓
DEAL INTAKE (parameters entered: NOI, cap rate, loan amount, tenants, financials)
  ↓
ROOTS (documents uploaded, checklist tracked, Back of Napkin auto-runs)
  ↓
OPERATIONS WORKBENCH (deal lives here — all modules as tabs)
  ↓
  ├── Bond Desk: tranches computed from deal NOI/DSCR/LTV
  ├── Rating: credit grade computed from deal financials
  ├── Surety: premium estimated from deal loan amount
  ├── Treasury: budget categories from deal cost structure
  ├── Draws: schedule from deal budget
  ├── Covenants: thresholds from deal parameters
  ├── Hawkeye: investor matching from deal rating/size/sector
  └── All numbers are LIVE CALCULATIONS from the same source data
  ↓
PLACEMENT (Hawkeye matches investors, book builds, deal closes)
  ↓
POST-CLOSE MONITORING (covenants, draws, treasury)
```

**The #1 thing that needs to happen:** When deal parameters are entered, every downstream module computes from those parameters. Not fake data. Not placeholders. Real math.

---

## THE BUILD (Start to Finish)

### Phase 0: Fix What's Broken NOW
1. **Operations Workbench** — this is the CORE of the platform. A deal detail page where every module lives as a tab. It exists in code (OperationsPages.tsx → OperationsDealDetailPage) but requires creating a deal first, and the tabs don't compute from deal data. This needs to work without auth for demo purposes.
2. **Command Center** — needs to be the pipeline dashboard showing all deals with status, not a static bond command component
3. **Remove fake EagleEye data** — the 1,103 lines of fabricated signals make the platform look hollow

### Phase 1: Deal Data Foundation
4. **Deal data model** — comprehensive schema covering all deal types (Bond, M&A, Sparrow, Term Lending) with all parameters: property/company info, financials, loan terms, tenants, sponsors
5. **Deal Intake form** — real input form that captures all parameters. Different fields per deal type. Saves to backend.
6. **Deal API** — CRUD endpoints + computed metrics endpoints. When you GET a deal, it returns the entered parameters PLUS all computed metrics (DSCR, LTV, ICR, rating grade, tranche sizing, premium estimate)
7. **Seed 2-3 demo deals** — pre-loaded with realistic parameters so the platform has data to display on first load. Use Jacaranda Trace PLOM ($231M) as the anchor deal.

### Phase 2: Wire Modules to Deal Data  
8. **Bond Desk** reads deal parameters → computes tranche structure, waterfall, pricing
9. **Rating Intelligence** reads deal parameters → computes credit metrics against JP Morgan benchmarks
10. **Back of the Napkin** auto-runs when deal is created → stores results
11. **Surety** reads deal parameters → estimates premium, recommends LC strategy
12. **Treasury** generates budget categories from deal cost structure
13. **Covenants** sets thresholds from deal type defaults
14. **Draws** creates schedule from deal budget
15. **Hawkeye** matches investors from deal rating/size/sector

### Phase 3: Data Stack (Real External Data)
16. **FRED connector** — live treasury curves, SOFR (Bond Desk needs this)
17. **EMMA connector** — muni bond trade comps (Bond Desk + Hawkeye)
18. **EDGAR connector** — institutional holdings (Hawkeye investor profiling)
19. **Chrome connector** — universal web access for anything without an API

### Phase 4: BD & Content
20. **EagleEye** — real pipeline, not fabricated signals
21. **Contact Strategy** — CRM with actual relationship tracking
22. **Outreach** — email/call sequences tied to contacts
23. **Content Library** — actual produced memos, teasers, decks
24. **Heat Maps** — geographic viz of deal pipeline

### Phase 5: Advanced
25. **ORCA/C-Suite** — agent management, dispatch visualization
26. **Tech Stack** — API subscription management panel
27. **Data Connectors** — connector health dashboard
28. **Atticus** — legal matter tracking
29. **Dashboard aggregation** — all dashboard numbers computed from live deal data

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Data entered once flows everywhere.** When a deal is loaded with parameters (NOI, cap rate, loan amount, coupon, tenants, etc.), those numbers must compute and display correctly in EVERY module downstream — Bond Desk, Rating, Surety, Treasury, Hawkeye, Dashboards. Nothing is a placeholder. Everything is a live calculation from the source data.

---

## MODULE STATUS & BUILD REQUIREMENTS

### 1. DEAL INTAKE (CRITICAL — BUILD FIRST)
**Status:** Has a basic modeling page but NOT a real deal input system
**What It Needs:**
- Full deal parameter input form: property address, asset type, NOI, cap rate, purchase price, loan amount, coupon, term, amortization, occupancy
- Tenant rent roll input (name, unit, SF, rent, lease expiry, lease type)
- Owner/user financials input (revenue, COGS, EBITDA, balance sheet items)
- Sponsor/guarantor PFS input
- Deal type selector: Bond / M&A / Sparrow / Term Lending
- **ON SAVE:** deal parameters write to backend and become the source of truth for every other module
- Every number entered here MUST flow downstream

### 2. COMMAND CENTER (NOT BUILT)
**Status:** Shows a static bond command center component, not a real command center
**What It Needs:**
- Pipeline overview: all active deals across all LOBs with status
- Deal cards showing key metrics pulled LIVE from deal parameters
- Status progression: Intake → Underwriting → Structuring → Rating → Placement → Closed
- Action items / tasks per deal
- Bernard integration: ask Bernard about any deal, get real answers based on deal data
- This is the HOME BASE — the first thing you see when you log in

### 3. OPERATIONS / DEAL DETAIL
**Status:** Has workspace tabs but most show demo data not tied to actual deal parameters
**What It Needs:**
- When you click into a deal, ALL tabs compute from that deal's entered parameters
- Bond Stack: computes tranches, DSCR, LTV, spread from the deal's actual NOI/cap rate/loan amount
- Draws/Covenants: covenant thresholds set from deal parameters, draw schedule from budget
- Treasury: card spend and budget categories from deal's actual budget breakdown
- Rating: credit metrics computed from deal's actual financials
- Surety: premium estimates from deal's actual loan amount and risk profile

### 4. ROOTS (INGESTION LAYER)
**Status:** Has a workspace component but document management is not functional
**What It Needs:**
- Document upload that actually stores files (Dropbox integration specced)
- Document checklist per deal type (Bond needs: appraisal, Phase I, rent roll, financials, title, survey. M&A needs: CIM, financials, org chart, customer concentration. Sparrow needs: tax returns, PFS, business plan)
- Status tracking: which docs received, which missing, which reviewed
- Back of the Napkin auto-runs when financials are uploaded
- OCR/parsing of uploaded financials into structured data

### 5. BOND DESK / GENIE
**Status:** Has components (DealPulseTicker, BondStackDesk, CMBSStackingDesk, etc.) with demo data
**What It Needs:**
- Pull deal parameters from Deal Intake — don't generate fake numbers
- Tranche sizing computed from actual NOI, DSCR targets, and LTV constraints
- Coupon, spread, and pricing based on actual rate environment (FRED integration)
- Call/put analysis based on actual deal terms
- Waterfall model computed from actual tranche structure
- Export: term sheet generation from computed structure

### 6. EAGLEEYE (BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT)
**Status:** Has a scout dashboard with 1,103 lines of fabricated demo signals
**What It Needs:**
- REMOVE all fake generated deals
- Replace with actual pipeline: real prospects, real contacts, real deal flow
- Contact Strategy: real CRM with actual relationship data
- Outreach: email/call tracking tied to real contacts
- Heat Maps: geographic visualization of actual deal pipeline
- Content Library: actual memos, teasers, decks that have been produced
- BD sub-engines (Bond, ICRE, O/U, M&A): filtered views of the same real pipeline

### 7. HAWKEYE (BOND PLACEMENT)
**Status:** Has a placement scout with mock investor data
**What It Needs:**
- Investor matching based on actual deal parameters (rating, size, sector, geography)
- Investor data from real sources (EDGAR 13F, EMMA trades) — specced in data stack doc
- Book building: track indications of interest per deal
- Allocation: when deal is placed, record who bought what
- Teaser generation from actual deal parameters, not templates

### 8. BACK OF THE NAPKIN
**Status:** Backend calculators built and working (owner/user + investor RE)
**What It Needs:**
- Frontend page with input form (currently shows placeholder or API-only)
- Form fields match the calculator inputs (financials for O/U, property data for ICRE)
- Results display with the 8 ratios, grades, and officer's read
- Integration: when deal parameters are entered in Deal Intake, Napkin auto-computes
- Link from Deal Intake: "Run Quick Spread" button triggers Napkin with deal's data

### 9. RATING INTELLIGENCE
**Status:** Has a component but runs on static data
**What It Needs:**
- Compute credit metrics from deal parameters: DSCR, LTV, ICR, D/EBITDA
- Grade against JP Morgan benchmarks (A/BBB+/BBB-/Sub-IG thresholds in CLAUDE.md)
- Moody's/S&P methodology comparison using actual deal metrics
- Rating recommendation based on computed metrics, not static display

**Status:** Has a complete surety module component
**What It Needs:**
- Premium estimates computed from actual deal loan amount
- 3C scoring (Character, Capacity, Capital) from sponsor data entered in Deal Intake
- LC strategy recommendation based on deal AUM tier (from CLAUDE.md: $0-15M surety, $15-40M hybrid, $40-80M LC dominant, $80M+ self-collateralized)
- Carrier matching from actual deal parameters

### 11. TREASURY (RAMP)
**Status:** Built with mock data engine (240 txns, 18 cards)
**What It Needs:**
- Budget categories generated from deal's actual budget breakdown
- Card spend simulation based on deal's actual cost structure
- Rebate calculation from actual managed spend (1.5%)
- When Ramp API keys arrive: flip RAMP_MODE=live, zero frontend changes needed

### 12. PHOENIX (DISTRESSED CRE)
**Status:** Built with 5 demo deals and 12 radar opportunities
**What It Needs:**
- Replace demo deals with real pipeline when deals exist
- Underwriting calculator should accept real inputs, not just return precomputed data
- 60-day bridge timeline should be editable per deal
- Bond handoff should actually create a deal in Bond Desk with Phoenix parameters

### 13. NIGHTVISION (COMPLIANCE)
**Status:** Has a component with compliance monitoring
**What It Needs:**
- Covenant thresholds set from deal parameters
- Breach detection computed from actual covenant values vs thresholds
- KYC/AML/OFAC checks integrated with real entity data

- Services: Claude API, FRED, EMMA, EDGAR, Ramp, Dropbox, Stripe, SendGrid, Supabase
- Credential management (masked keys, rotation status)
- Usage tracking per API

### 17. DATA CONNECTORS
**Status:** Placeholder page, connectors specced but not built
**What It Needs:**
- Build the actual connector layer (specced in data-stack-design.md)
- Priority: FRED first (live rates for Bond Desk), then EMMA (bond comps), then EDGAR (investor holdings)
- Chrome connector for universal web access
- Status dashboard showing connector health, last sync, record counts

### 18. ALL DASHBOARDS (11 dashboards)
**Status:** Built with static demo numbers
**What It Needs:**
- Every number computed from actual deal data in the system
- Bond Dashboard: metrics aggregated from all bond deals
- M&A Dashboard: metrics from M&A pipeline
- ICRE Dashboard: property portfolio metrics
- Owner/User Dashboard: business banking portfolio
- Treasury dashboards: actual card spend, rebate, escrow data
- Comp/Success Fee: computed from deal fees
- P×V: deal economics computed from actual volume and pricing
- Investor/Partner/Client: role-appropriate views of the same data

## THE FUNDAMENTAL FIX

**The #1 problem is: data doesn't flow.** Every module generates its own fake numbers independently. The fix:

1. **Deal Intake becomes the single source of truth** — all parameters entered here
2. **Backend stores deal parameters** in a real data model (Supabase or in-memory with persistence)
3. **Every module READS from the deal data** — no module generates its own numbers
4. **Calculations happen in backend services** — credit metrics, tranche sizing, rating grades, premium estimates all computed from deal parameters
5. **Frontend displays computed results** — no static numbers, everything live

This is the difference between a demo and a product. Right now it's a demo with pretty screens. The product is when you enter a $150M bond deal and every module instantly shows the correct DSCR, LTV, tranche structure, premium estimate, investor matches, and rating grade — all computed from the same source data.

## V1 (MANUS) MODULES MISSING FROM V3

These modules existed in the Manus V2 build (live at nestadvisors.ai) and were NOT carried into V3. The code is in the repo at `frontend/app/(app)/admin/` — needs to be ported to V3 design system.

| Module | V1 Lines | Description | Priority |
|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Dashboard** | 534 | Full institutional dashboard — the V1 was the good one | HIGH |
| **Forensic Audit** | 128 | Document checklist, financial integrity, severity-weighted findings, review gate | HIGH |
| **AI Tools** | 284 | Agent tooling panel — configure and deploy AI agents | HIGH |
| **Bond Intel** | 267 | Bond intelligence — market data, comps, spread analysis | HIGH |
| **Marketing** | 219 | Marketing engine — campaigns, content calendar, outreach | MEDIUM |
| **Licensing** | 216 | Licensing management — regulatory, state licenses, compliance | MEDIUM |
| **Modeling** | 141 | Financial modeling — proforma, scenarios, stress testing | HIGH |
| **Monitor** | 140 | Post-close monitoring — covenant surveillance, alerts | MEDIUM |
| **Blockchain** | 109 | Chain agent — ERC-1400, tokenized bond issuance | LOW |
| **HFT Fund** | 95 | Quantum agent — $32.4M AUM, portfolio management | MEDIUM |
| **Marketplace** | 96 | Bond marketplace — secondary market, listings | LOW |
| **Lenders** | 88 | LenderScout — 800+ lender database, matching | HIGH |
| **Risk** | 83 | Sentinel — 7-dimension risk assessment | HIGH |
| **Docs** | 83 | Document management (Roots should absorb this) | MEDIUM |
| **Vector Agent** | 95 | Market signal monitoring — 14 signals, 15-min intervals | MEDIUM |
| **Deals Detail** | 72 | Deal detail page — V1 version | REFERENCE |

**V1 source code location:** `nest/frontend/app/(app)/admin/`
**Action:** Port each module to V3 design system (Vite + React, NEST terminal aesthetic). The V1 code is Next.js App Router — needs adaptation but the content and layout are the reference.

---

## BOTTOM LINE

The platform LOOKS like an investment bank. It needs to WORK like one. Enter a deal → every number flows → every module computes → every dashboard updates.

The V1 Manus build had modules that worked. V3 lost them in the rebuild. Port them back, wire them to real data, and make the workflow flow.

---

## API KEYS LOADED IN .env (backend/.env)

These are active and configured. Kevin should NOT need to re-provision any of these:

| Key | Service | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY | Claude API (AI engine) | Active |
| ANTHROPIC_MODEL | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | Set |
| OPENROUTER_API_KEY | OpenRouter (multi-model routing) | Active |
| FRED_API_KEY | Federal Reserve Economic Data | Active |
| SUPABASE_URL | Supabase (database) | Configured |
| SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY | Supabase service role | Active |
| SENDGRID_API_KEY | SendGrid (email) | Active |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | Stripe (payments) | Active |
| DEEPSEEK_API_KEY | DeepSeek (AI fallback) | Active |
| COMPOSIO_API_KEY | Composio (tool integration) | Active |
| JWT_SECRET_KEY | JWT auth signing | Set |
| SECRET_KEY | Flask secret | Set |

Also configured: ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS, B_TRANCHE_COUPON_PCT, FUND_TICK_SECONDS, MGMT_FEE_PCT, WC_SPREAD_BPS, HOST, PORT, FRONTEND_ORIGIN, JWT_TTL_HOURS, DEBUG

---

## WHAT WAS OMITTED IN V3 REDESIGN (intentional — different approach)

These V1 features were deliberately NOT carried forward because V3 took a different architectural approach:

| Feature | V1 Approach | V3 Approach | Notes |
|---------|------------|------------|-------|
| Auth flow | Supabase Auth + JWT | Same JWT but simplified | V3 auth works, just streamlined |
| Deployment | Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend) | Local dev, Railway backend | V3 not yet deployed to production |
| Routing | Next.js App Router with layouts | Vite + wouter SPA | Intentional — faster dev, simpler |
| CSS | Custom CSS classes (serif, sage, mono, card, kpi) | Tailwind + inline styles | V3 design system is different |
| Deal flow | Server-rendered with Supabase persistence | Client-side with in-memory + trpc hooks | Needs real persistence wired |

## WHAT WAS SIMPLY LOST (unintentional — needs to come back)

These V1 intelligence engines existed, called real backend APIs, and were dropped in the V3 rebuild without replacement:

| Module | V1 Lines | Backend APIs It Called | What It Did |
|--------|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | 534 | `/api/deals`, `/api/agents/status`, `/api/market/signals/latest`, `/api/fund/hft/war-chest`, `/api/blockchain/events` | Full institutional dashboard: pipeline KPIs, rate ticker, deal cards with readiness, agent fleet grid, HFT war chest strip, blockchain feed |
| **Forensic Audit** | 128 | `/api/audit/standards`, `/api/audit/run` | FBI/DOJ-standard audit: expandable category checks, overall score /100, clean opinion flag, JP Morgan ready flag, critical issues, category breakdown |
| **Bond Intelligence** | 267 | `/api/bond-intel/milestones`, `/api/bond-intel/team`, `/api/bond-intel/100pct-path`, `/api/bond-intel/types`, `/api/bond-intel/rating-readiness`, `/api/phase-bonds/structure` | 5-tab engine: Rating Readiness (input form → achievable ratings + gaps), Milestone Gates (10 gates to 100% financing), Professional Team, Phase Bonds (multi-phase structuring), 100% Financing Path |
| **AI Tools / CNS** | 284 | `/api/nervous-system/dashboard`, `/api/data/market-rates`, `/api/nervous-system/ingest` | Central Nervous System: 13 plugin logos that light up when active, live market rates, task router (select type + prompt → routes to correct AI), result display with latency/tokens, activity log |
| **Risk / Sentinel** | 83 | `/api/deals`, `/api/bond-tools/audit` | 7-dimension risk assessment per deal (Market, Construction, Credit, Operational, Regulatory, Sponsor, Environmental), click deal → audit → grade + composite score |
| **Modeling / Prometheus** | 141 | `/api/bond-tools/grade`, `/api/bond-tools/optimize` | Bond Grading (base → enhanced with structural enhancements), Stress Testing (4 scenarios), Bond Optimization (current vs market rate, recommended actions, annual savings) |
| **Lender Scout** | 88 | `/api/surety/providers`, `/api/lenders-direct/search` | 800+ lender database, provider cards, pipeline kanban (6 stages), deal-based lender search |
| **Marketing Studio** | 219 | Marketing API lib (content types, generate, batch, history) | Content command center: select type → generate with Jimmy Lee tone, 3-column layout, batch package (exec summary + teaser + term sheet + deck), copy/download/print, markdown preview |

**CRITICAL:** The backend services for ALL of these still exist at port 8000. The routes respond. The intelligence logic is in the Python services. Only the FRONTEND was lost. Porting = read V1 component → adapt to V3 Vite/React → keep all API calls identical.

**Source code for porting:** `nest/frontend/app/(app)/admin/` and `nest/frontend/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`
**Detailed porting guide:** `nest/V1_MODULES_TO_PORT.md` That's the product.
