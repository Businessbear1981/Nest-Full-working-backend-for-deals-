    options: ['Revenue bond', 'General Obligation bond', 'Industrial revenue bond', 'Special assessment bond'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'GO bonds pledge the municipality\'s unlimited taxing authority. Revenue bonds rely only on project revenues — no taxing power backing.',
    nestContext: 'NEST CCRC deals use revenue bonds backed by occupancy revenues — DSCR stress testing is critical because there is no GO backstop.',

    q: 'TEFRA requires a public approval process for which type of bonds?',
    options: ['All municipal bonds', 'Tax-exempt private activity bonds (PABs)', 'General obligation bonds only', 'Taxable municipal bonds'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'TEFRA applies to private activity bonds seeking tax-exempt status. A public hearing + governmental approval is required. Missing this step triggers taxability.',
    nestContext: 'HBO2\'s $155M bond is a §501(c)(3) PAB. TEFRA hearing was held 2024-11-14 in St. Petersburg. Bond counsel (Squire Patton Boggs) certified compliance.',

    options: ['4.90%', '5.00%', '5.10%', '4.78%'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'Current yield = annual coupon / market price = $50 / $1,020 = 4.902%. Price premium above par means current yield < coupon rate.',
    nestContext: 'NEST bonds target 6.25–6.75% current yield at issue. As they season and credit improves (occupancy stabilizes), price appreciation drives yield compression — capital gain for early bond buyers.',

    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'G-17 is the bedrock fair dealing rule: no deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practices. It requires disclosure of material facts affecting the securities.',
    nestContext: 'NEST bonds are sold to QIBs under 144A. G-17 still applies to any MSRB-registered dealer in the placement chain — material non-disclosure could void the offering.',

    options: ['Same day (T+0)', 'Next business day (T+1)', 'Two business days (T+2)', 'Three business days (T+3)'],

    options: ['5.71%', '6.00%', '6.30%', '5.50%'],
    correct: 0,
    explanation: 'Current yield = annual coupon / market price = $60 / $1,050 = 5.714%. When a bond trades at a premium (price > par), current yield < coupon rate.',
    nestContext: 'This math applies directly to NEST\'s HBO2 bonds. If the $155M bond at 6.25% coupon is priced at 101 in secondary trading, current yield = 6.25% / 1.01 = 6.19%.',

    options: ['$50', '$300', '$5,300', 'Unlimited'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Maximum loss for a call buyer is the premium paid: $3 × 100 shares = $300. The option simply expires worthless if XYZ stays below $50.',

    options: ['The last traded price before redemption', 'The next calculated NAV after the order', 'The NAV from the previous trading day', 'The bid price quoted at time of order'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Mutual funds use forward pricing: the investor receives the NEXT NAV calculated after order submission (typically 4 PM ET close). This is the forward pricing rule.',

    options: ['File a pre-borrow notice with FINRA', 'Locate shares available to borrow', 'Obtain signed customer authorization', 'Report the short to the OCC'],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: 'Rule 203 requires a "locate" — the broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds to believe shares can be borrowed before executing the short sale. The locate must be documented.',
